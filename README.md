Project Overview

Phishing attacks pose a significant threat to individuals and organizations, as attackers attempt to steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and financial details through fraudulent emails. This project aims to develop a comprehensive phishing detection system that combines email parsing, URL extraction, and machine learning to identify phishing emails effectively.

The project follows a structured approach:
1. Email Parsing: Extract and process email content using Python libraries to analyze its structure, including the subject, body, and attachments.
2. URL Extraction: Identify and extract URLs from email content to assess potential phishing links.
3. Phishing Detection: Implement a basic rule-based detection system using keyword matching to identify phishing attempts.
4. Machine Learning Integration: Train and integrate a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression) to classify emails as phishing or legitimate with higher accuracy.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the machine learning model based on key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The final system provides real-time phishing detection and alerts, making it suitable for both individual and organizational use. Future enhancements could include more sophisticated models, real-time deployment, and improved feature extraction for greater accuracy in detecting phishing attempts.
